# Crop and Fertiliser Recommendation System

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to recommend the most suitable crops and fertilizers based on soil and environmental conditions like NPK values, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.

## 📁 Files
- `Week1_Crop_Recommendation.ipynb`: Code for preprocessing, EDA, and baseline model
- `dataset.csv`: Dataset used for model training
- `plots/`: Visualizations from EDA

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn)
3. Run the notebook/script

## ✅ Output
- Crop prediction using ML
- Fertilizer recommendation logic (rule-based)

## 📅 Internship Timeline
This repository documents progress for the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship (Apr–May 2025).
