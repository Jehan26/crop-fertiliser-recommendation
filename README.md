# ðŸŒ¾ Crop and Fertiliser Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This machine learning project recommends the best-suited crops and appropriate fertilizers based on soil nutrients and weather conditions. It's developed as part of the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship (Aprâ€“May 2025).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Week1_Crop_Recommendation.ipynb` â€“ Notebook with preprocessing, EDA, and ML
- `dataset.csv` â€“ Dataset for training
- `README.md` â€“ Project overview and instructions

## ðŸ“Š Features Used
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- pH
- Rainfall
- Temperature
- Humidity

## âœ… Current Status
- Data cleaning and EDA completed
- ML model (Random Forest & KNN) implemented
- Initial fertilizer logic added based on NPK deficiencies

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Model optimization and dashboard visualization
- Real-time fertilizer mapping
